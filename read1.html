            <h4>Increased Role</h4>

            <p>Ridley had a breakout campaign in 2020, setting career highs in receptions (90) and receiving yards (1,374) while posting 9 TD. Thrust into the WR1 role due to nagging injury issues to Julio Jones, he showed big play ability and the versatility to attack from the slot or the boundary, as a deep threat, and as a catch and run weapon on short and intermediate routes. With Jones gone, expect Ridley, who has averaged over 11 targets per game when Jones was out of the lineup, to be a full-on fantasy stud in 2021. His versatility, HC Arthur Smith's offensive creativity, and the presence of Kyle Pitts, Russell Gage, Hayden Hurst, and even Mike Davis and Christian Blake keeping defenses honest could equate to new heights for Ridley, who has proven to be nearly uncoverable at times. Given the Titans are inheriting the entire contract this is probably about as good of a deal as could be expected for Atlanta. This move is likely a ding to Matt Ryan's value and the offense as a whole as they lose one of the best playmakers in the game. That being said, this trade elevates rookie TE Kyle Pitts as the Falcons search for playmakers to go along with Calvin Ridley. The Titans get a much needed offensive weapon after losing Corey Davis and Jonnu Smith to free agency.</p>

   <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">Falcons got Best prospect in NFL Draft?</h4>
   <p class="list-group-item-text">With the Falcons sitting on the No. 4 pick in last April's NFL Draft, many teams called general manager Terry Fontenot to inquire about trading up to their spot. Fontenot fielded the calls but declined every offer and chose one of the biggest "can't-miss" prospects in recent memory, Florida Gators tight end Kyle Pitts.</p>

   <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">What's The Falcons' Worst Offseason Move?</h4>
   <p class="list-group-item-text">Mistakes are bound to happen each offseason when it comes to free agency. Draft picks are bungled, contracts never meet expectations and players that are declining in play continue to earn to top dollar. What was the Atlanta Falcons biggest mistake? There's one, but it had to be done.</p>
